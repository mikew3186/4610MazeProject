PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Our final project is a maze game in which users can solve a series of mazes of increasing difficulty. A random maze is generated and once the player solves it they will be placed in a larger, more difficult maze.
We procedurally generate our maze and use procedural mesh generation to generate the walls.
We also have a player model which is viewable at any time because our game uses a third person camera.
Lastly, we have in game music and on-screen text that shows what level the player is currently on and a running stopwatch of how long they have been playing that specific level.
